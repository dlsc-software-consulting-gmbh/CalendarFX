Release 8.4.1
-------------

- Added a callback to control whether a calendar entry can be edited (change start time,
  change end time, move, delete). See DateControl.setEntryEditPolicy.

- Opened up DayEntryViewSkin to make it more reusable. Several private methods are now
  protected.

- Fixed issues related to "nervously" dragging entries inside DayView or WeekView.

Release 8.4.0
-------------

In general: this is a major update and many things have changed, have been added, have been
removed. When you decide to upgrade to this release then please be aware that you might have
to invest a lot of time first before your application will be back to where it was before.

- CalendarEvent: the event hierarchy has changed. There is now a new super event type
  called ANY. Direct sub event types are CALENDAR_CHANGED and ENTRY_CHANGED. All other
  event types are children of ENTRY_CHANGED.

- CSS: completely reworked / rewrote the calendar.css stylesheet. Styling is much more
  verbose and consistent now. Sorry for the changes in this area but it really needed
  to be cleaned up.

- Performance: switched from "brute force" update strategy where often everything was
  recreated in the views to a more fine-grained update strategy where changes are based
  on the event types. Also lowered the scene graph complexity by removing containers
  that only served layout purposes and that could be replaced with custom layout method
  implementations or with a grid pane.

- Real printing capabilities have been added, including a detailed preview dialog.

- New complex views:
	DetailedDayView - combines a day view, a time scale, calendar header, all day view,
	 				  weekday header, an agenda view, and a scrollbar to a single view.
	 				  This view replaces most of those individual controls except for the
	 				  AgendaView in the DayPage(Skin).

	DetailedWeekView - same as the day view, but for multiple days. Replaces the individual
					   controls in the WeekPage(Skin).
	MonthSheetView - a grid style view that can be used to display an entire year at once.

- New simple views:
	MarginSelector - supports entering print margins for the four sides of a document
	WeekFieldsView - allows the user to specify the "first day of week" and the "number of
	days" required for the first week of the year to actually be called "first".

- DayPage: now implements a responsive layout to hide the left-hand side (agenda view, year
  month view, today label) when the available width is too small to show the left-hand and
  the right-hand side.

- The class "Interval" now performs validity checks. It is no longer possible to create
  intervals with invalid bounds, e.g. the end date can not be before the start date.

- Renamed the setStartDate/Time() and setEndDate/Time() methods in Entry to changeXXX().
  Example: setStartDate has become changeStartDate().

  Motivation: the start/end date/time properties are read-only, so there can not be any
  setters. Currently these setter methods were convenience methods updating the interval
  property on Entry. In addition the "new" changeXYZ() methods ensure that the interval
  always stays valid, which means that the start date / time will always be before the
  end date / time and that the minimum duration property will be respected.

  Calling changeStartTime/Date() will make an entry start earlier while keeping its duration,
  so the whole entry moves as is to a new location. Calling changeEndTime/Date() behaves
  differently. It will change the duration of the entry. These two different semantics
  make it easier to edit a given entry.

- EntryDetailView: now ensures that the time bounds are always valid.

- DayViewScrollPane: a new scrollpane to properly scroll and at the same time resize the
  scrolled day view. This pane makes sure that the hour layout strategy will be properly
  observed, e.g. "always show 8 hours in viewport".

- AgendaView: now fires RequestEvent(s) that contain the entry on which the user clicked
  and not just the start time of the entry.

- Calendar: this model class used to carry a "visible" property. This property had to be
  moved to a view class as it is only used by the view. This change was needed when the
  print preview dialog was added. Inside this view the user wants to be able to show or
  hide a calendar without changing its visibility in the regular calendar view.

- Calendar: added startBatchUpdates(), stopBatchUpdates() to efficiently perform many calendar
  changes without continuously updating the views.

- CalendarView: moved the "layout" button support (used to toggle between standard and swimlane
  layout) to DayPage and WeekPage. Only these two are actually supporting the two different
  layouts. The button was useless in the context of the MonthPage and the YearPage.

- WeekDayHeaderView: renamed inner class DateCell to WeekDayCell.
